This survey report describes key literature surveys on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods for network analysis of intrusion detection and provides a brief tutorial description of each ML/DL method. Papers representing each method were indexed, read, and summarized based on their temporal or thermal correlations. Because data are so important in ML/DL methods, we describe some of the commonly used network datasets used in ML/DL, discuss the challenges of using ML/DL for cybersecurity and provide suggestions for research directions. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {Malware is the umbrella term that denotes attacking any system by malicious software. During the last few years, the popularity of Android smartphones led to the sneak of several malware applications into different Android markets without any difficulty. As a consequence of this, malware applications have been grown exponentially in the Android markets. Unfortunately, most of these markets suffer from an inability to detect malware, which results in increasing the probability of infecting users' phones with these malware applications. The present paper focuses on developing an efficient computational framework based on Deep Belief Networks for malware detection. The proposed framework merges high level static analysis, dynamic analysis and system calls in feature extraction in order to achieve the highest accuracy. The evaluation compares the most familiar machine learning approaches that were applied in malware detection with the proposed framework. The obtained results demonstrate that Deep Belief Networks technique can realize 99.1{\%} accuracy with the presented dataset. Over and above that, we develop our complete static analysis jar which adopts different efficient methods in an attempt to facilitate and speed up the static analysis by handling all the Android applications in only one step rather than considering one application at a time.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM. In the present digital network, where people share critical information through online social networks on a daily basis, it becomes essential to identify security loopholes and vulnerabilities in social networks. Social spam has become inevitable with increasing number of users exploiting it for communication. Spam profiles have become dodgy for the social platform and beyond, since they pollute the network with insignificant and malicious information. This put an adverse impact on economy, politics, and society. In this paper, we contribute along various dimensions. First, we created a large dataset of genuine and spam profiles and exploited it for validation purpose. Second, we exploited trust based feature for anomalous accounts detection. Third, we proposed a unified framework to classify various types of Twitter users. Fourth, results of the proposed work have been compared with three existing state-of-the-art techniques showing the effectiveness of the proposed technique based upon promising feature selection.},

abstract = {Modeling network traffic is gaining importance in order to counter modern threats of ever increasing sophistication. It is though surprisingly difficult and costly to construct reliable classifiers on top of telemetry data due to the variety and complexity of signals that no human can manage to interpret in full. Obtaining training data with sufficiently large and variable body of labels can thus be seen as prohibitive problem. The goal of this work is to detect infected computers by observing their HTTP(S) traffic collected from network sensors, which are typically proxy servers or network firewalls, while relying on only minimal human input in model training phase. We propose a discriminative model that makes decisions based on all computer's traffic observed during predefined time window (5 minutes in our case). The model is trained on collected traffic samples over equally sized time window per large number of computers, where the only labels needed are human verdicts about the computer as a whole (presumed infected vs. presumed clean). As part of training the model itself recognizes discriminative patterns in traffic targeted to individual servers and constructs the final high-level classifier on top of them. We show the classifier to perform with very high precision, while the learned traffic patterns can be interpreted as Indicators of Compromise. In the following we implement the discriminative model as a neural network with special structure reflecting two stacked multi-instance problems. The main advantages of the proposed configuration include not only improved accuracy and ability to learn from gross labels, but also automatic learning of server types (together with their detectors) which are typically visited by infected computers.},

abstract = {Over the last few years' machine learning has migrated from the laboratory to the forefront of operational systems. Amazon, Google and Facebook use machine learning every day to improve customer experiences, suggested purchases or connect people socially with new applications and facilitate personal connections. Machine learning's powerful capability is also there for cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is positioned to leverage machine learning to improve malware detection, triage events, recognize breaches and alert organizations to security issues. Machine learning can be used to identify advanced targeting and threats such as organization profiling, infrastructure vulnerabilities and potential interdependent vulnerabilities and exploits. Machine learning can significantly change the cybersecurity landscape. Malware by itself can represent as many as 3 million new samples an hour. Traditional malware detection and malware analysis is unable to pace with new attacks and variants. New attacks and sophisticated malware have been able to bypass network and end-point detection to deliver cyber-attacks at alarming rates. New techniques like machine learning must be leveraged to address the growing malware problem. This paper describes how machine learning can be used to detect and highlight advanced malware for cyber defense analysts. The results of our initial research and a discussion of future research to extend machine learning is presented.},

abstract = {Malware is the umbrella term that denotes attacking any system by malicious software. During the last few years, the popularity of Android smartphones led to the sneak of several malware applications into different Android markets without any difficulty. As a consequence of this, malware applications have been grown exponentially in the Android markets. Unfortunately, most of these markets suffer from an inability to detect malware, which results in increasing the probability of infecting users' phones with these malware applications. The present paper focuses on developing an efficient computational framework based on Deep Belief Networks for malware detection. The proposed framework merges high level static analysis, dynamic analysis and system calls in feature extraction in order to achieve the highest accuracy. The evaluation compares the most familiar machine learning approaches that were applied in malware detection with the proposed framework. The obtained results demonstrate that Deep Belief Networks technique can realize 99.1{\%} accuracy with the presented dataset. Over and above that, we develop our complete static analysis jar which adopts different efficient methods in an attempt to facilitate and speed up the static analysis by handling all the Android applications in only one step rather than considering one application at a time.},

abstract = {Operationalizing machine learning based security detections is extremely challenging, especially in a continuously evolving cloud environment. Conventional anomaly detection does not produce satisfactory results for analysts that are investigating security incidents in the cloud. Model evaluation alone presents its own set of problems due to a lack of benchmark datasets. When deploying these detections, we must deal with model compliance, localization, and data silo issues, among many others. We pose the problem of "attack disruption" as a way forward in the security data science space. In this paper, we describe the framework, challenges, and open questions surrounding the successful operationalization of machine learning based security detections in a cloud environment and provide some insights on how we have addressed them.},

abstract = {We explored unsupervised machine learning algorithms, specifically graph analytics, applied to behaviors observed in heterogeneous network sensor data for discovering anomalous behavior that could include novel attacks. In addition, we explored the potential difficulties with applying unsupervised machine learning approaches to anomaly detection in a network-defense context to understand how to integrate inherently imperfect anomaly-detection approaches into the workflow of a cyber defense infrastructure. Two general approaches can be used to discover anomalies: (1.) detecting rarity, i.e., finding those activities that are observed the least frequently in a set of observations, and (2.) detecting novelty, i.e., finding activities with the lowest estimated probability of observation based on prior observations of baseline (presumably “normal”) data. This effort will describe the case of detecting rarity. In this paper, we describe the entire pipeline starting from explaining the data used, the data ingest, the quantization of features, application of graph analytics to the data, post-processing to reduce results, and measuring the performance. A network-penetration experiment was setup to conduct the network attacks and generate the data that is the input to this work. Baseline methods are proposed and compared to the main method that is described in this paper.},

In the investigation, we experiment with different combination of Deep Learning architectures including Auto-Encoders, and Deep Neural Networks with varying layers over Malicia malware dataset on which earlier studies have obtained an accuracy of (98{\%}) with an acceptable False Positive Rates (1.07{\%}). But these results were done using extensive man-made custom domain features and investing corresponding feature engineering and design efforts. In our proposed approach, besides improving the previous best results (99.21{\%} accuracy and a False Positive Rate of 0.19{\%}) indicates that Deep Learning based systems could deliver an effective defense against malware. Since it is good in automatically extracting higher conceptual features from the data, Deep Learning based systems could provide an effective, general and scalable mechanism for detection of existing and unknown malware.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a malware which is spreading largely around the world and imposing serious threats to information assets and victimizes internet users by hijacking and encrypting their files, and then demanding payment to get back access to the files. Seeking system vulnerabilities, ransomware tries to seize control over the victim's files and system, until the victim agrees to the attacker's demands. In this paper, we have extended the work by focusing on Indicator of Compromises (IOCs) for ransomware using Cuckoo Sandbox. These IOCs are used to set the base for the analysis and classification of new ransomware into their respective class. Further, working for the implementation of the proposed idea, we have automated the system using machine learning algorithms for the classification of ransomware variants in the real time environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real time, comprehensive and usable methodology to classify the ransomware in their respective classes.},
